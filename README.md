# Hdf5Vis

# An university practical project under the supervision of Linus Seelinger at University Heidelberg.
# If given a HDF5 file created by MUQ (https://mituq.bitbucket.io/source/_site/index.html) with standard naming, 
# it is supposed to generate various plots with up to 12 subplots of QOIs, QOI_diff and samples. 

# It was my first bigger programming project and done in about 6 weeks.
# It is still quite rough (e.g. the path is still hardcoded), but can provide quick visualisation of data, 
# if the naming and structure is standard (from Nov 2020).
